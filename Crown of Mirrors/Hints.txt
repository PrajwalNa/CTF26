Hint 1:
Check input structure first. The crown expects five 4-letter stars joined by fixed separators.

-----------------------------------------------
Hint 2:
There are multiple validation routes. If behavior changes under tracing, that is part of the design.

-----------------------------------------------
Hint 3:
`sigA` and `sigB` are gates. Recover the per-path crown/mirror math and solve the real no-taint route.
