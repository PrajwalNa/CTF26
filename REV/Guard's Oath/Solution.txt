1. Load `Oath.exe` in IDA/Ghidra/Cutter.
2. Find the validation function that:
   - transforms 9 input bytes in a loop
   - compares the result to a constant 9-byte table.
3. Check the program flow, see it doesn't print flag, look near the exit call for main function.
4. There would be a dead code function which decodes the flag and prints it, it has the key and all, manually decode the flag.
FLAG: {_0ATH_BR3KER_}
