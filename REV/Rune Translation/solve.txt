Author Solve - Finals at Stormhaven Academy

Core mechanic:
- Input is not compared directly.
- Each input byte is mapped through a 1:1 substitution table:
  out[i] = runeMap[input[i]]
- The transformed bytes are compared against inscription[].

How to solve:
1. Recover runeMap[256] and inscription[] from the binary (or source).
2. Invert runeMap:
   inv[runeMap[x]] = x
3. Decode inscription with inv to get the required plaintext phrase.
4. Input that phrase to pass and print the flag.

Recovered answer:
moonsilver ink

Recovered flag:
ACAD3MY_RUNE_CERT1F1ED

Notes:
- runeToken[] only affects display formatting (how bytes are shown as rune glyphs).
- The real check is runeMap[] + inscription[].
