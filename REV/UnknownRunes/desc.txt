The ancient city of Stormhaven has long been a crossroads for those seeking power, glory, gold, or simply a warm meal.

A mage hunts forbidden knowledge to empower him. A warrior settles debts with his fists in a tavern that's seen better days. An artificer races to breathe life into cracked metal and silent circuits. A bard does what bards do - everything wrong, beautifully.

Four paths. Four fates. Somewhere in the whispers of the city, answers are hidden, but they won't be in any tongue you recognise.

Not all paths lead to glory. Choose wisely.
