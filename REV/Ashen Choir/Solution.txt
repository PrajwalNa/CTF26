Author Notes - Ashen Choir

Real flag target:
{S0NG_0F-7H3_SP1RIT5}

Fake flag target:
S1L3NT_F0R3ST

Canonical real token:
ASHN-CHOR-ECHO-NITE-WARD

Known fake branch tokens:
Fake A: WISP-CHOR-ECHO-NITE-VALE
Fake B: DUSK-CHOR-ECHO-NITE-WAIL
Fake C: MIST-CHOR-ECHO-NITE-GLEN

High-level solve strategy:
1. Parse and normalize input into 20 bytes.
2. Recover dispatchVoices and confirm 24 voice functions.
3. Rebuild voiceCore equations and state updates.
4. Reconstruct:
   - stateMachineGate (edge + class counts)
   - constraintGate (core + late)
   - signature gates (real and decoy)
5. Extract split constants and recombine.
6. Derive the real-valid token by scripting constraints.
7. Use final state words to derive real decryption keystream and recover real flag.
