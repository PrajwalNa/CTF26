RuneISA is used in Unknown Runes and A Legacy of Darkness, the others are unrelated to ISA
If you want the most up-to-date version of the ISA spec/VM check [here](https://github.com/PrajwalNa/CTF26/blob/main/RuneISA/Source/ISAspec.md) in RuneISA folder.
The version in Unknown Runes is missing some bug fixes, debug functionality, SYSCALL extensions, etc., while the version in DarkLegacy is also missing most of the same except it has the SYSCALL extensions.
