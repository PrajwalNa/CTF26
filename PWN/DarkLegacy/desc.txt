*He embraced the darkness.*

There are alawys absurd tales of powerful men shared in haze of strong liquor, but that's all they are, grand tales for entertainment. All but one, the man from Stormhaven. Within a decade he had toppled three kingdoms. Within two, the world had a new name for him.

Then, one morning, he was simply gone. No body. No note. No throne.

That was your great grandfather, a man who has always fascinated you, you went through all records you could find, even asked your parents but to no avail. The fire of curiousity burning within you demanded more, so you complied and set on a adventure. 

It took months of digging through every record, journal, & article out there but you finally stumbled upon something, a workshop, hidden deep within the Ashengrave forest, the old man sure knew how to keep people away from his stash. 

Today, after a week of sifting through various trinkets and research notes you found something tucked behind a false wall, a small arcane device, still humming, still waiting.

There's a prompt. There's a question. And somewhere in the old man's machine, a legacy left behind for the right person to find.

Answer carefully, for the old man was not known for his generosity.
