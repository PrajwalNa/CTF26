The Lich’s Token
[pwn]

*Kings rot. Legacies do not.*

Stormhaven has buried many names, but some names claw their way back.
In a forgotten vault, an ancient relic still stirs beneath dust and rust, the old seals endure, the token of passage is not gifted to wandering hands.

You are sent with little and promised even less.
No records, no guiding whispers, no mercy.

Follow the rite, break the chain, and claim what the dead still call their own.
Some gates open to wit, some open to force.
